**Exercises Section 9.3.5**

**Exercise 9.29:** Given that vec holds 25 elements, what does
vec.resize(100) do? What if we next wrote vec.resize(10)?  
**vec.resize(100) will increase the size of vec to hold 100 elements, and initialise
the new elements with the default constructor for the vec type.**

**Exercise 9.30:** What, if any, restrictions does using the version of resize
that takes a single argument place on the element type?  
**It must have a default constructor.**
